## Overview 

Visual perception is a highly dynamic and complex process which heavily relies on the use of visual working memory in order to construct a comprehensible perception of the rapidly shifting visual stimuli of the world, ([Rademaker et al., 2015](#relevant-works) though function of visual working memory can be disrupted. Recent works (e.g.,[Derrfuss et al., 2017](#relevant-works)) have established interrupting (task relevant) and distracting (task irrelevant) stimuli to have a significant debilitating effect on recall, an effect that is exacerbated with increased variance between the target and distractors. ([Clapp et al., 2009](#relevant-works)) Previously, distractor paradigms have been limited to lower level visual stimuli (i.e. line orientation, gradients), but faces represent a more complex class of stimuli, requiring multiple levels of processing for recognition and encoding. Here, we apply the concepts of visual distraction to faces to examine the extent as to which visual working memory, and specifically, complex visual processing, can be biased after encoding. 

 Manipulating variables of age and gender, we construct a 360 degree facespace ([Lorenc et al., 2014](#relevant-works)), from which target stimuli, and distractors can be drawn. 

## Experimental Design 

We essentially replicate the standard distraction paradigm. Subjects are given a single face as a target stimulus, and given time to encode ("Remember this face.'). A question ("Male or female?" or "Young or old?") will precede the distracting stimulus (DS). Feedback to this question will be provided to subjects. Subjects will then be cued to pinpoint the target face on a 360 degree wheel. ("Find the face you remembered")
